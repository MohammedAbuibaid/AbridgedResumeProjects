## Comparison of Adaptive Beamforming Algorithms

### Description
- Simulates various adaptive beamforming algorithms (Constant Modulus, Least Mean Squares, Normalized LMS, Recursive Least Square) using MATLAB.
- Dynamically adjusts antenna array weights for optimal signal quality, incorporating comprehensive performance analysis including Bit Error Rate (BER) and antenna array beam pattern visualization.
- Experiment setup involves a QPSK-modulated signal transmitter, interfering signals, and a receiver with a uniform linear array of antennas, enabling the exploration of algorithm effectiveness under varying signal-to-noise ratios.

## Energy-Efficient Massive MIMO Design: Optimal Number of Antennas Ensuring Guaranteed Bit Rate

### Description
- Focuses on optimizing energy efficiency in massive multi-input multi-output (mMIMO) antenna systems while maintaining guaranteed bit rate (GBR).
- Utilizes symmetric game theory's best response approach to numerically solve energy efficiency optimization in a multi-cell network under GBR constraints.
- Incorporates a data traffic model that accounts for different user equipment capabilities and mobile data applications, translating them into GBR levels.
