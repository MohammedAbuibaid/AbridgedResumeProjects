## Selected Projects
Below is a collection of sample projects that I have worked on during my education

### Comparison of Adaptive Beamforming Algorithms

#### Description
- Simulates various adaptive beamforming algorithms (Constant Modulus, Least Mean Squares, Normalized LMS, Recursive Least Square) using MATLAB.
- Dynamically adjusts antenna array weights for optimal signal quality, incorporating comprehensive performance analysis including Bit Error Rate (BER) and antenna array beam pattern visualization.
- Experiment setup involves a QPSK-modulated signal transmitter, interfering signals, and a receiver with a uniform linear array of antennas, enabling the exploration of algorithm effectiveness under varying signal-to-noise ratios.

### Energy-efficient massive MIMO system: Exploiting user location distribution variation

#### Description
- This project investigates the impact of user location distribution (ULD) variation on the energy efficiency of a massive MIMO system in 5G networks.
- It proposes dynamic resource allocation strategies that leverage ULD variations, modeling daily ULD changes by dividing a cell into areas with different user densities. The study assesses variations such as boundary focused, middle focused, uniform, and center focused ULDs.
- The research concludes that optimal antenna numbers depend more on ULD models than on cell loading. Findings show that up to one-third of active antennas can be deactivated daily, potentially conserving 36â€“50% of energy.
- Contributes to the development of more energy-efficient designs in 5G systems, offering practical solutions for dynamic resource allocation in real-world scenarios.

### Energy-Efficient Massive MIMO Design: Optimal Number of Antennas Ensuring Guaranteed Bit Rate

#### Description
- Focuses on optimizing energy efficiency in massive multi-input multi-output (mMIMO) antenna systems while maintaining guaranteed bit rate (GBR).
- Utilizes symmetric game theory's best response approach to numerically solve energy efficiency optimization in a multi-cell network under GBR constraints.
- Incorporates a data traffic model that accounts for different user equipment capabilities and mobile data applications, translating them into GBR levels.

### SDN-based Service Discovery and Assignment Framework to Preserve Service Availability in Telco-based Multi-Access Edge Computing

#### Description
- This project addresses the challenge of maintaining high service availability in Telco-based Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) amid the growing number of connected User Equipment (UE), such as IoT devices and Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs).
- It proposes an SDN-based dynamic framework for efficient service discovery and assignment in a distributed MEC infrastructure, considering UE's location, service demand, network link status, and performance requirements.
- The framework aims to enhance the packet delivery ratio and reduce user-perceived latency, addressing key issues in 3GPP standards related to UE mobility and network heterogeneity.

### Multivariate Polynomial Public Key Digital Signature Algorithm: Semi-covariance Analysis and Performance Test over 5G Networks

#### Description
- This project evaluates the robustness of the Multivariate Polynomial Public Key (MPPK) Digital Signature algorithm, a Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithm, against brute force attacks using semi-covariance correlation analysis.
- It involves generating MPPK/DS key pairs with true random numbers from quantum computers and comparing their robustness with traditional RSA and SPHINCS algorithms.
- Additionally, the project assesses the latency performance of MPPK/DS over various network types including 5G, WiFi, and local area networks, providing vital insights into the suitability of PQC algorithms in the quantum computing era.

### Edge Workloads Monitoring and Failover: a StarlingX-Based Testbed Implementation and Measurement Study

#### Description
- This project focuses on High Availability (HA) in Edge Clouds, addressing challenges in the Distributed Cloud Infrastructure (DCI) due to geographical dispersion and networking instability.
- It features the development and optimization of a dynamic failover functionality using StarlingX, an HA-protected and scalable DCI virtualization platform. This functionality monitors Edge workloads, specifically for IoT applications, to efficiently recover from deployment or Edge node failures.
- A key part of the study involves testing with a StarlingX-based DCI testbed, monitoring microservice-architected IoT applications, and analyzing failover measurements in relation to Edge resource and network speed constraints.
