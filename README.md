## SDN-based Service Discovery and Assignment Framework to Preserve Service Availability in Telco-based Multi-Access Edge Computing

### Description
- This project addresses the challenge of maintaining high service availability in Telco-based Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) amid the growing number of connected User Equipment (UE), such as IoT devices and Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs).
- It proposes an SDN-based dynamic framework for efficient service discovery and assignment in a distributed MEC infrastructure, considering UE's location, service demand, network link status, and performance requirements.
- The framework aims to enhance the packet delivery ratio and reduce user-perceived latency, addressing key issues in 3GPP standards related to UE mobility and network heterogeneity.

## Multivariate Polynomial Public Key Digital Signature Algorithm: Semi-covariance Analysis and Performance Test over 5G Networks

### Description
- This project evaluates the robustness of the Multivariate Polynomial Public Key (MPPK) Digital Signature algorithm, a Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithm, against brute force attacks using semi-covariance correlation analysis.
- It involves generating MPPK/DS key pairs with true random numbers from quantum computers and comparing their robustness with traditional RSA and SPHINCS algorithms.
- Additionally, the project assesses the latency performance of MPPK/DS over various network types including 5G, WiFi, and local area networks, providing vital insights into the suitability of PQC algorithms in the quantum computing era.
